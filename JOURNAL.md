## 10/16/2025 - Started  

I just created the folder, repo and the project for this project I am going to start to draw up a Bill of Materials and also start on the Custom PCB footprint as i am using a Gateron Magnetic Jade Low Prifile and i could not find any footprint for this on github or elsewhere.
